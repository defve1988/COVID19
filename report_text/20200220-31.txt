Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 

Situation Report – 31 

Data as reported by 20 February 2020* 

HIGHLIGHTS 

• One new country (Islamic Republic of Iran) reported cases of COVID-19 in the 
past 24 hours.  

• China has revised their guidance on case classification for COVID-19, removing 
the classification of “clinically diagnosed” previously used for Hubei province,  
and retaining only “suspected” and “confirmed” for all areas, the latter 
requiring laboratory confirmation. Some previously reported “clinically 
diagnosed” cases are thus expected to be discarded over the coming days as 
laboratory testing is conducted and some are found to be COVID-19-negative.  

• 

In early January, following the notification of the occurrence of cases of 
COVID-19 among travelers from Wuhan, China, WHO established a Global 
Surveillance System to collect and organize essential information to describe 
and monitor COVID-19. All WHO regions have implemented the reporting of 
COVID-19 cases either through existing or newly-established data collection 
systems. Please see the Subject in Focus section for more information.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: WHO Global Surveillance for Human Infection with COVID-19 Occurring 
Outside China 

Following the notification of the occurrence of cases of COVID-19 among travelers from Wuhan, China in early January, 
WHO set up a Global Surveillance System to collect and organize essential information to describe and monitor the 
extent of the global outbreak. The goals of global surveillance are to: 1) Monitor the global extent of the epidemic; 2) 
Provide early epidemiological information to support risk assessment at the national, regional and global levels; 3) 
Rapidly detect new cases in countries where the virus was not previously circulating; 4) Monitor trends of the disease 
after a first case is imported and; 5) Provide epidemiological information to guide response measures. In line with the 
International Health Regulations (2005), all Member States’ IHR National Focal Points were requested to immediately 
report any new confirmed case of COVID-19 and, within 48 hours, provide information related to clinical, 
epidemiological, and travel history using the WHO standardized case reporting form. The current version of the case 
reporting form can be found here in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese. 

WHO regions implemented immediate reporting of COVID-19 cases through systems already in place – such as The 
European Surveillance Systemin the European Region, EMFLU in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and FluNet in the 
Americas Region; or by setting up a new electronic data collection system (South-East Asia region).The flow of data 
from WHO Regional Offices to WHO HQ was organized using the existing Global Influenza Surveillance system, allowing 
regions to rapidly transfer information. A Global Surveillance COVID-19 database centralizing all COVID-19 cases 
reported from outside China is maintained at WHO HQ, and data analysis is conducted daily to: follow the transmission 
of the disease between countries; describe the characteristics of human- to- human transmission within clusters of 
cases; describe the characteristics of affected persons and their exposure history; and support the evaluation of public 
health measures implemented in response to the epidemic . 

SUBJECT IN FOCUS (UPDATE): Advanced Analytics and Mathematical Modelling 

Since the publication of modeling estimates in yesterday’s ‘Subject in Focus’, one research group (Ref. 12) has 
provided a correction of their estimate of the Infection-Fatality Ratio (IFR), with the new estimate being 0.94% (95% 
confidence interval 0.37-2.9). This replaces the lowest estimate of IFR of 0.33%, but remains below the highest 
estimate of 1.0% (Ref. 11).

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 

WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 

• 

• 
• 

Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 

• 

To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish as well);  Critical Care of Severe 
Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 

severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 

During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the 
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 

• 

• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.

likely exposure location, 20 February 2020  

Note for figure 2: Of the 1073 cases reported outside China, 30 were detected while apparently asymptomatic. For 
the remaining 1043 cases, information on date of onset is available only for the 233 cases presented in the 
epidemiologic curve.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 

WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 

• 

• 
• 

Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 

• 

To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish as well);  Critical Care of Severe 
Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 

severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 

During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the 
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 

• 

• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.
