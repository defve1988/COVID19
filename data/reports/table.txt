• CDC has developed a rRT-PCR test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV.  
IV. Statistical Modelling 
WHO is working with a number of mathematical model groups to better understand the 
epidemiology and transmission dynamics of this event.  
• Phylogenetic analysis suggests based on 23 full genome sequences submitted to GISAID, that 
the sequences exhibit little genetic variation, which is indicative of a recent origin of the 
sampled and sequenced viruses. The sequenced genomes show no evidence of additional 
introductions of the virus from a non-human animal reservoir, although the numbers of 
sequences are limited at present.  (Andrew Rambaut, University of Edinburgh, UK) 
• Updated estimated number of cases in Wuhan based on baseline assumptions and 
alternative scenarios:  a total of 4000 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (uncertainty range: 
1,000 – 9,700) had onset of symptoms by 18th January 2020 (Imai et al, 
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-
coronavirus/) 
• The median size of the Wuhan outbreak is estimated to be 4, 050 infections (95% CI: 1.700-
7, 950) by using an estimate of 10 days from exposure to detection and an effective 
population of 20 million people in Wuhan catchment as of January 20 (Matteo Chinazzi et al

II. PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE: 
WHO: 
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been 
reported. WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as 
requested. 
• Developed the surveillance case definitions and reporting forms for human infection with 2019-
nCoV and is updating it as the new information becomes available. 
• Developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, clinical management, infection prevention 
and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus , 
risk communication and community engagement. 
• Prepared disease commodity package for supplies necessary in identification and management 
of confirmed patients. 
• Provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the 
novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations. The first protocol that is available is a: 
Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 
infection. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an 
outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the study protocols can be used to refine 
recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological 
transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, 
impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that is 
available is a: Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-
nCoV) infection. 
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on 
surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways 
to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim 
guidance for countries, updated to take into account the current situation. 
• Utilizing global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and 
control, clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
WHO is working with networks of specialists to analyze 2019-nCoV full genome sequences as they 
become available.  
WHO has not received evidence that the virus has changed. WHO awaits further information from 
Chinese officials.   
5 
Current estimates of the incubation period range from 2-10 days, and these estimates will be refined 
as more data become available. Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the 
virus to others is critical for control efforts. In previous outbreaks of other coronavirus, such as 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), some individuals can be asymptomatic 
and transmit to others. Detailed epidemiological information from more people infected is needed 
to determine the infectious period of 2019-nCoV.  
WHO has issued advice to people on how to protect themselves from 2019-nCoV infection, as for 
any virus that spreads via the respiratory route: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-
coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public 
In addition, it is vitally important in health care settings, that health care workers are able to protect 
themselves from infection.  WHO guidance on infection prevention and control measures in health 
care facilities is here: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-
during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected  
The strategic objectives of the response are to interrupt the transmission of the virus from one 
person to another in China, to prevent exportation of cases from China to other countries and 
territories, and to prevent further transmission from exported case if they were to happen. This can 
be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and 
control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness raising 
in the population, risk communication. 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 
and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human to human transmission occurred 
through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV 
can be similar.  The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory 
infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain 
distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in 
hospitals, especially in emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms 
suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travellers are encouraged to seek 
medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Travel guidance was 
77updated on 24 January. 
6 
III. COUNTRY RESPONSE: 
China: 
• Public education on disease prevention and environmental hygiene further strengthened in 
public places across the city, farmers’ markets in particular. As of 23 January, the National 
Health Commission revised protection standards and specifications for medical workers and 
strengthened prevention and control measures against 2019-nCoV in hospitals. 
• National authorities are conducting active case finding in all provinces. 
• Search expanded for additional cases within and outside of Wuhan. 
• Active / retroactive case finding in medical institutions in Wuhan. 
• The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was closed on 1 January 2020 for 
environmental sanitation and disinfection. Market inspection in expansion to other markets.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness- raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, clinical management, infection prevention and 
control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus , risk communication 
and community engagement. 
• Prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and 
supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including 
novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the study protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and 
case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand 
spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for 
implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that 
is available is a: Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 
infection. 
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, updated to take into 
account the current situation. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce 
the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in 
emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their healthcare provider.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019-
nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.

ANNEX 1: Temporary Recommendations under the International Health Regulations 
associated with the declaration of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV as a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern  
To the People’s Republic of China 
Continue to: 
• Implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of 
the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its 
containment.   
• Enhance public health measures for containment of the current outbreak. 
• Ensure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce.  
• Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China. 
• Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of 
this outbreak and measures to contain it. 
• Share relevant data on human cases. 
• Continue to identify the zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for circulation with WHO as 
soon as it becomes available. 
• Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travelers 
for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic.   
To all countries 
It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be 
prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact 
tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoVinfection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is 
available on the WHO website. 
Countries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR.  
Any detection of 2019-nCoV in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant 
epidemiological information) should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging 
disease. 
Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and 
international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and 
collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing 
research.   
The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.   
Countries must inform WHO about travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against 
actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.  
The Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make 
new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation.  
To the global community 
As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronav iruses required substantial efforts 
to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity 
and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of 
the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential 
importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment. 
Provide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate 
access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics.  
Under Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with 
international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, 
conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public 
health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may 
request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information 
about measures and the justification received.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness- raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• WHO has actively sought misinformation and responded to rumours through ‘myth busting’ on WHO’s social 
media and its website. 
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019-
nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement. 
• Prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and 
supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including 
novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that is available is a: 
Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. 
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, updated to take into 
account the current situation. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce 
the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in 
emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their healthcare provider.

*Confirmed cases in China include cases confirmed in Hong Kong SAR (18 confirmed cases, 1 death), Macao SAR (10 confirmed cases) and 
Taipei and environs (11 confirmed cases). 
Note: Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for 2019-nCoV. 
ERRATUM: Please note, due to a typographical error, the new case reported by Canada was 
incorrectly placed in the “possible or confirmed transmission outside of China” column. It is 
corrected here.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness- raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019-
nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including 
novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce 
the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in 
emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their healthcare provider.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce 
the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their healthcare provider.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019-
nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including 
novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding 2019-nCoV, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019-
nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including 
novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce 
the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding 2019-nCoV, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019-
nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including 
novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce 
the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health

• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the 
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish as well);  Critical Care 
of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the 
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish);  Critical Care of Severe Acute 
Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the 
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish);  Critical Care of Severe Acute 
Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the 
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following: 
• 
• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have 
not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low. 
However, it’s understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the situation. It’s a good idea to get the 
facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See Frequently Asked 
Questions) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential 
sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the 
situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See  Protection measures for 
everyone). 
If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow 
the advice issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild 
illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-
existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable. 
(See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is 
spreading).

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish);  Critical Care of Severe Acute 
Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have 
not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low. 
However, it’s understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the situation. It’s a good idea to get the 
facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See Frequently Asked 
Questions) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential 
sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the 
situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See  Protection measures for 
everyone). 
If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow 
the advice issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild 
illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-
existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable. 
(See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is 
spreading).

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have 
not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low. 
However, it’s understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the situation. It’s a good idea to get the 
facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See Frequently Asked 
Questions) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential 
sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the 
situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See  Protection measures for 
everyone). 
If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow 
the advice issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild 
illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-
existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable. 
(See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is 
spreading).

The majority of these measures are related to denial of entry of travelers originating from China or from countries 
reporting on-going transmission of COVID-19, quarantine requirements for foreigners, self-isolation of returning 
nationals, and visa restrictions. The public health rationale for these additional health measures is mainly linked to 
vulnerabilities (e.g. lack of capacity for diagnostic and response, small island states context) in receiving countries, 
and the uncertainties about the virus transmission and disease severity.  
Preliminary analysis of countries reporting cases that have imposed restrictive measures suggest that such measures 
may have delayed the importation of new cases, but did not prevent the importation of the disease. WHO has 
emphasized to Member States that additional measures should be proportionate to the public health risk, short in 
duration, and reconsidered in light of the evolution of the outbreak and the constant advancements of knowledge 
about the virus and the disease. 
WHO has published updated advice for international traffic, and continues to recommend against the application of 
any travel or trade restrictions in relation to the current COVID-19 outbreak. 
WHO continues to engage with travel and tourism international organizations and industry associations to enable 
compliance with the IHR on avoidance of unnecessary interference with international traffic. Joint statements have 
been issued by WHO in collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and UN World Tourism 
Organization (UNWTO), and will shortly be issues in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.  
†Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become 
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which ther e is 
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within 
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and 
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected. 
Terms:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by 
increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples. 
Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location. 
Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.   
Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases. 
Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and interrupt onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling. 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese);  Critical Care of 
Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT 
(available in French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19); Critical Care Severe 
Acute Respiratory Infection 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and 
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to 
gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 
COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have 
not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of being infected are low. It is 
understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from 
reliable sources to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See 
Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health 
authority and your employer on accurate information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you 
live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your 
family (see Protection measures for everyone). 
If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow 
the advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19 
infected will cause mild illness, it can make some people very ill and in some people it can be fatal. Older people, and 
those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes) 
appear to be at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.  
†Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as addi tional data become 
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which ther e is 
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within 
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and 
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected. 
Terms:

Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by 
increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples. 
Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location. 
Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.   
Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases. 
Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
• 
To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection 
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are 
updated regularly. 
• WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
• WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese);  Critical Care of 
Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT 
(available in French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19); Critical Care Severe 
Acute Respiratory Infection 
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and 
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to 
gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 
COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection. 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is 
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that 
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek 
guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate 
information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the 
situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone). 
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the 
advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection 
will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, 
and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or 
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).
