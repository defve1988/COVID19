Coronav irus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 

Situation Report – 27 

Da ta as reported by 16 Februa ry 2020 * 

HIGHLIGHTS 

• No new countries reported cases of COVID -19 in the past 24 hours.  

• A third death of a COVID -19 patient has been reported outside of China. This 
individual was a tourist from China visiting France.  

• Studies to assess the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID -19 
cases 
in different settings are therefore critic al to furthering our 
understanding of this virus and associated disease. Several early investigation 
master pro toco ls or master forms are available for countries to use. More 
information can be found here.

TECHNICAL FOCUS: Early Epidemiologic and Clinical investigations  

The recent emergence of COVID -19 means that understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features and 
risk factors for infection remains limited, whether about the general population, health workers or in household and 
other “closed” settings. Studies to assess the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of cases in different settings are 
therefore critical to furthering our understanding of this virus and associated disease. They will also provide the robust 
information needed to feed forecasting models. 

Several early investigation master pro toco ls or master forms are available for countries: 
1. FFX (First Few X number o f cases and their close contacts) transmiss ion pro tocol: case and close contact 
tracing in the general population. Contact : earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who. int 

FFX is the primary investigation protocol to be initiated upon identification of the initial laboratory -confirmed 
cases of COVID -19 in a country. 

For a more targeted approach on specific groups and more precise estimation of epidemiolog ical parameters, 
three other investigation protocols are available: 

2. Househo ld (HH) transmiss ion study pro tocol. Contact : earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who. int 

3. Risk factors assessment for Health Workers (HCW) pro tocol. Contact: earlyinvestigations-2019-
nCoV@who. int 

4. Env ironmental samp ling protoco l (in development) 

5. Global COVID-19 Clin ical Characterization Case Record Form : a standard approach to collect clinical data of 
hospitalized patients is necessary to better understand clinical characteristics of the disease and treatment 
interventions. Anonymized clinical data and information related to patients with suspected or conf irmed 
infections can be shared. Contact: EDCARN@who. int for log -in details. 

To support country implementation of the first two protocols (FFX, HH), it is recommended 
to use the Go.Data field electronic tool for case and contacts data collection and 
management. The FFX and HH protocol questionnaire templates are available in Go.Data. 
Visit www.who. int/godata or contact godata@who. int for more information. 

These protocols and forms have been designed so that data can be rapidly and systematically collected and shared in 
a format that facilitates aggregation, tabulation and analysis across different settings g lobally. We encourage any and 
all countries and study centres to contribute to this effort regardless of resource availability or patient volume. The 
ownership of the primary data remains firmly with the individual countries/sites. 

Data collected using these investigation protocols will be critical to refine recommendations for case definitions and 
surveillance, characterize key epidemiolog ical features of COVID -19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of 
disease, and impact on the community and to inform guidance for application of countermeasures such as case 
isolation and contact tracing . More information can be found at this webpage.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 

WHO’s strateg ic objectives for this response are t o: 

• 

• 
• 

Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identif ication, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness -raising in the population and 
risk communicat ion. 

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 

• 

To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID -19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiolog ical and virolog ical characteristics of the first cases of COVID -
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) outbreak, clinical management , 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019 -nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therape utics. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerg ing respiratory viruses, including 
novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiolog ical transmission features of COVID -19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 

countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who. int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate g lobal work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling , diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with g lobal expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling . 

RECOMMENDAT IONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 

During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle -East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID -19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the 
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following : 

• 

• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing , especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing , and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travel lers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 

WHO’s strateg ic objectives for this response are t o: 

• 

• 
• 

Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identif ication, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness -raising in the population and 
risk communicat ion. 

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 

• 

To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID -19, please go to this webpage. 
• WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  
• WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiolog ical and virolog ical characteristics of the first cases of COVID -
19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.  
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 
informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 
• WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) outbreak, clinical management , 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
• WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019 -nCoV.  
• WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
• WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 
• WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therape utics. 
• WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerg ing respiratory viruses, including 
novel coronaviruses.  
• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiolog ical transmission features of COVID -19, help understand spread, 
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 

countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: 
https://www.who. int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations  
• WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate g lobal work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling , diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated 
regularly. 
• WHO is working with g lobal expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling . 

RECOMMENDAT IONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 

During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle -East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and 
fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID -19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the 
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following : 

• 

• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. 
Frequent hand-washing , especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. 
• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. 
• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover 
coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing , and wash hands). 
• Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially 
in emergency departments. 

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory 
illness either during or after travel, travel lers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history 
with their health care provider.
