• On 29 January, WHO held its third press briefing to provide update on the 
situation. The audio can be found here. 
• WHO recommends that the interim name of the disease causing the current 
outbreak should be “2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease” (where ‘n’ is for novel 
and ‘CoV’ is for coronavirus). This name complies with the WHO Best Practices for 
Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, which were developed through a 
consultative process among partner agencies. Endorsement for the interim name 
is being sought from WHO’s partner agencies, World Organization for Animal 
Health (OIE) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The final name of the 
disease will be provided by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). WHO 
is also proposing ‘2019-nCoV’ as an interim name of the virus. The final decision 
on the official name of the virus will be made by the International Committee on 
Taxonomy of Viruses.

Today, the first two confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease were 
reported in Italy; both had travel history to Wuhan City.  
• WHO’s Risk Communication Team has launched a new information platform 
called WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN). EPI-WIN will use a 
series of amplifiers to share tailored information for specific target groups. EPI-
WIN began this week to establish connections to health care and travel and 
tourism sectors and will work with food and agriculture and business/employer 
sectors next week.

departments of the UN Secretariat. It held its first meeting yesterday via 
teleconference. This mechanism will help WHO focus on the health response 
while the other agencies will bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, 
economic and developmental implications of the outbreak. Additional 
members will be included depending on the evolution of the outbreak and its 
impact globally.
